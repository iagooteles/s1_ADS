SCRUM => lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems

Requires a scrum master to foster an environment where:
1. A Product Owner orders the work for a complex problem into a Product Backlog.
2. The Scrum Team turns a selection of the work into an Increment of value during a Sprint.
3. The Scrum Team and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next Sprint.
4. Repeat

Scrum is built upon by the collective intelligence of the people using it;
The rules o Scrum guide their relationships and interactions;

Scrum theory => scrum is founded on empiricism and lean thinking;
empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is observed.
lean thinking reduces waste and focuses on the essentials.

Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and to control risk. Scrum engages groups of people who collectively have all the skills and expertise to do the work and share or acquire such skills as needed.

Scrum combines four formal events for inspection and adaptation within a containing event, the Sprint. These events work because they implement the empirical Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation.


SCRUM PILARS =>
- Transparency: the work must be visible to those performing the work as well as those receiving the work;
Artifacts that have low transparency can lead to decisions that diminish value and increase risk.
Transparency enables inspection. Inspection without transparency is misleading and wasteful.
- Inspection: The Scrum artifacts and the progress toward agreed goals must be inspected frequently and diligently to detect potentially undesirable variances or problems;
Inspection enables adaptation. Inspection without adaptation is considered pointless. Scrum events are designed to provoke change.
- Adaptation: If any aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits or if the resulting product is unacceptable, the process being applied or the materials being produced must be adjusted. The adjustment must be made as soon as possible to minimize further deviation.
Adaptation becomes more difficult when the people involved are not empowered or self-managing. A Scrum Team is expected to adapt the moment it learns anything new through inspection.

SCRUM VALUES =>
- Commitment;
- Focus;
- Openness;
- Respect;
- Courage;

SCRUM TEAM => 
- 1 PO (Product owner) - responsável por product backlog e requisitos; is accountable for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum Team. How this is done may vary widely across organizations, Scrum Teams, and individuals;
    Developing and explicitly communicating the Product Goal;
    Creating and clearly communicating Product Backlog items;
    Ordering Product Backlog items; and,
    Ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understood.

    The Product Owner may do the above work or may delegate the responsibility to others. Regardless, the Product Owner remains accountable.

- 1 Scrum master - organizador; The Scrum Master is accountable for establishing Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide. They do this by helping everyone understand Scrum theory and practice, both within the Scrum Team and the organization; 
    Scrum Masters are true leaders who serve the Scrum Team and the larger organization.

The Scrum Master serves the Scrum Team in several ways, including:
● Coaching the team members in self-management and cross-functionality;
● Helping the Scrum Team focus on creating high-value Increments that meet the Definition of
Done;
● Causing the removal of impediments to the Scrum Team’s progress; and,
● Ensuring that all Scrum events take place and are positive, productive, and kept within the
timebox.

The Scrum Master serves the Product Owner in several ways, including:
● Helping find techniques for effective Product Goal definition and Product Backlog management;
● Helping the Scrum Team understand the need for clear and concise Product Backlog items;
● Helping establish empirical product planning for a complex environment; and,
● Facilitating stakeholder collaboration as requested or needed.

The Scrum Master serves the organization in several ways, including:
● Leading, training, and coaching the organization in its Scrum adoption;
● Planning and advising Scrum implementations within the organization;
● Helping employees and stakeholders understand and enact an empirical approach for complex work; and,
● Removing barriers between stakeholders and Scrum Teams.

The Scrum Team is small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work within a Sprint, typically 10 or fewer people.
